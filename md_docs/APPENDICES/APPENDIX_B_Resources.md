# Chapter B: Appendix B: Resources

## Official Documentation

## Learning Objective

Quickly access the primary sources of truth for React and its ecosystem.

## Why This Matters

Official documentation is the most accurate and up-to-date resource. Learning to navigate it effectively is a crucial skill for any professional developer.

### Core React Documentation

- **React.dev**: The modern, official React documentation. It includes tutorials, guides, and a full API reference. This should be your first stop for any question.
  - [https://react.dev/](https://react.dev/)
- **React Legacy Docs**: The previous version of the documentation (reactjs.org). While still available, it primarily covers class components and older patterns. Useful for maintaining legacy projects.
  - [https://legacy.reactjs.org/](https://legacy.reactjs.org/)
- **The React Blog**: The official source for announcements, updates, and deep dives into new features from the React team.
  - [https://react.dev/blog](https://react.dev/blog)
- **React GitHub Repository**: The source code for React. The discussions and RFCs (Request for Comments) section are great places to see the future direction of React.

## Recommended Libraries Compatible with React 19

## Learning Objective

Discover key third-party libraries that complement React 19 and are widely used in production applications.

## Why This Matters

React is a library, not a framework. A rich ecosystem of third-party tools provides solutions for routing, state management, styling, and more. Choosing modern, well-maintained libraries is key to building robust applications.

### Frameworks

These provide a full-stack structure for building applications with React 19's latest features.

- **Next.js**: The most popular React framework, created by Vercel. It provides a production-ready environment with first-class support for Server Components, Actions, and optimized rendering strategies.
  - [https://nextjs.org/](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Remix**: A full-stack web framework focused on web standards and fundamentals. It has excellent support for form actions and data loading patterns that align well with React 19.
  - [https://remix.run/](https://remix.run/)
- **Waku**: A minimalist React framework with a focus on Server Components, created by one of the co-creators of Zustand and Jotai.
  - [https://waku.gg/](https://waku.gg/)

### Data Fetching & State Synchronization

- **TanStack Query (formerly React Query)**: The de-facto standard for managing server state. It simplifies fetching, caching, and updating data, and integrates seamlessly with Suspense and Server Components.
  - [https://tanstack.com/query](https://tanstack.com/query)

### State Management (Client-Side)

- **Zustand**: A small, fast, and scalable state-management solution. Its simple API makes it a great alternative to Redux or Context for many use cases.
  - [https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)
- **Jotai**: An atomic state management library. It's useful for managing many small pieces of state that can be composed together, avoiding large re-renders.
  - [https://jotai.org/](https://jotai.org/)
- **Redux Toolkit**: The official, opinionated toolset for efficient Redux development. It's still the standard for large-scale applications with complex, centralized state.
  - [https://redux-toolkit.js.org/](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)

### Forms

- **React Hook Form**: A performant, flexible, and extensible forms library. It minimizes re-renders and integrates well with validation libraries like Zod.
  - [https://react-hook-form.com/](https://react-hook-form.com/)
- **Zod**: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. It's commonly paired with form libraries to ensure data integrity from the client to the server.
  - [https://zod.dev/](https://zod.dev/)

### UI Components & Primitives

- **Shadcn/UI**: Not a component library, but a collection of reusable components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS that you can copy and paste into your apps. This gives you full ownership and control.
  - [https://ui.shadcn.com/](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- **Radix UI**: A library of unstyled, accessible UI primitives. It provides the building blocks (dropdowns, dialogs, tooltips) so you can focus on styling.
  - [https://www.radix-ui.com/](https://www.radix-ui.com/)

### Styling

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that has become incredibly popular in the React ecosystem. It allows for rapid UI development without writing custom CSS.
  - [https://tailwindcss.com/](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### Testing

- **React Testing Library**: The standard for testing React components in a way that resembles how users interact with them.
  - [https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
- **Vitest**: A modern, fast testing framework that integrates seamlessly with Vite-based projects. It's a great alternative to Jest.
  - [https://vitest.dev/](https://vitest.dev/)
- **Playwright**: A powerful end-to-end testing tool for modern web apps. Use it to test user flows across your entire application in real browsers.
  - [https://playwright.dev/](https://playwright.dev/)
